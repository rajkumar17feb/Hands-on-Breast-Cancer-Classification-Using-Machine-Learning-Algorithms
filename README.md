Project Title: "Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Kernel SVM, and Naive Bayes"
Problem Statement:
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and improving survival rates. This project aims to develop and compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign. The algorithms include Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Kernel SVM, and Naive Bayes.

The goal is to identify the most effective model for accurate classification, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. This will assist medical practitioners in making informed decisions based on the predictions of the models.

Dataset Overview:
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset will be used for this project. This dataset is well-known and widely used for binary classification tasks. It includes 569 instances of malignant and benign tumors with 30 feature columns that describe various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the digitized image.

Key Features:
ID: Unique identifier for each patient.

Diagnosis: Binary classification target, where 'M' denotes malignant and 'B' denotes benign.

Features: 30 numeric columns that describe characteristics of the cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

Example Features:
Radius_mean: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.

Texture_mean: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.

Perimeter_mean: Mean size of the core tumor.

Area_mean: Mean area of the tumor.

Smoothness_mean: Mean of local variation in radius lengths.
